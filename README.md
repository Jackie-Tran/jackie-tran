## Hi there 👋, I'm Jackie

- 🏫 I'm a 4th student at the University of Toronto studying Computer Science in the Software Engineering stream and a minor in Statistics.
- 👷 I just finished my co-op at [BookJane](https://www.bookjane.com/) as a Software Development Engineer. I've also worked at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/home/) as a Web and Systems Administrator.
- 🌱 Looking to learn more about Docker, Kubernetes and Machine Learning.
- 🎵 Other than software development, I also enjoy making music in my free time.

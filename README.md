### Hi there 👋, I'm Jackie

- 🏛 I'm a recent graduate from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Statistics.
- 👷 Currently freelancing as a Full Stack Developer while actively seeking full-time Software Engineering roles. Recently, I’ve been working on building a fitness app that connects users with their favourite influencers.
- 🌱 Looking to deepen my knowledge in Machine Learning, AI, and Software Architecture to expand my technical expertise and take on more challenging projects.
- 🧩 Outside of software development, I enjoy playing volleyball, working out and making music in my free time.
